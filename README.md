# OOP
Those are two of my university projects that I developed during my OOP course. Their purpose is to prove that i can use most of the basic OOP concepts such as inheritance, encapsulation, polymorphism, as well as dynamic allocation. The travel agency project also has a text-based interface with several options available in order to view, edit or add new data.
